The ultimate goal here is to produce a domain-specific language that will allow one to declaratively define a comic and have the comic rendered for them.

Right now it's just a little JS library that allows you to draw things mostly manually.

Comic.js is not anywhere near finished either, but it actually produces something sort of resembling a comic, at least.
