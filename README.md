The ultimate goal here is to produce a domain-specific language that will allow one to declaratively define a comic and have the comic rendered for them.

Right now it's just a little JS library that allows you to draw things mostly manually.

So, you probably want to check out comic.js and comicjs.html. That other stuff is some older code that I wrote a long time ago and never finished.

Not that comic.js is anywhere near finished either, but it actually produces something sort of resembling a comic, at least.
